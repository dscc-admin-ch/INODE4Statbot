# Statbot UI

This package contains the front- and back-end code for the Statbot UI.

## Running the Server

To run, first create a `.env` with the following variables:

	MODEL_NAME=[ModelName]
	INFERENCE_SERVER_URL=[Onyxia service address]

Along with the database parameters:

	DB_HOST=
	DB_PORT=
	DB_SCHEMA=
	DB_PASS=
	DB_USERNAME=
	DB_DATABASE=

Then run `docker compose up` to build and start the server.

### Importing/Exporting User Data

Once the server is running, the logs, whitelist and user data will be stored in `./userdata`. To import existing data from a previous instance, place it in `./userdata` before startup. If no existing user data has been provided, create an `admin` account and password using the login screen after startup.

### Managing Access

The user whitelist and password reset functions can be accessed in a browser via the administrator control panel at `http://[URL]/admin`. Alternatively, the databases in `./userdata` can be modified directly.
